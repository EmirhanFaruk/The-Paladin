Albert: phew! That was close! Well, as I was saying-

(Paladin interrupts Albert)

Paladin: shut up, you are annoying me with all your non-sense

Albert: Hey!! That's rude...

(Albert starts to think for a way to make the paladin follow him so he doesn't get killed)

Albert: I got an idea! Why don't we just....uhhh...go into the forest just ahead!

Paladin: hmmm...this bandits must be bountyhunters that the Slime King has hired.

Albert: oh! So what are we waiting for? Let's go into the forest to kill that guy!!!

Narrator: and so, our brave heroes went inside the forest to end the Slime King's life!
